- Mlpy is a Python, open source, machine learning library built on top of NumPy/SciPy, the GNU Scientific Library and it makes an extensive use of the Cython language. 
- mlpy provides a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning methods for supervised and unsupervised problems and it is aimed at finding a reasonable compromise among modularity, maintainability, reproducibility, usability and efficiency. mlpy is multiplatform, it works with Python 2 and 3 and it is distributed under GPL3.
- Suited for general-purpose machine learning tasks, mlpy's motivating application field is bioinformatics, i.e. the analysis of high throughput omics data.
